accurately predict future heart diseases based on current medical data and patient 
history. 
2. Combining traditional machine learning techniques with advanced artificial 
intelligence algorithms. 
3. Predictive models can help identify patients at risk of developing coronary 
artery disease or other cardiovascular issues before they have any symptoms, 
allowing doctors to intervene as early as possible and potentially save lives. 
4. Such models also aid in planning preventive care, detection of undiagnosed 
risk factors, and even in drug discovery and development processes.
